It must have been in 1994 when my friend Tibi gave me his copy of Rage Against The Machine's self-titled debut album. My mind was blown. This was music transcending the genres I was used to, it was not Rock, not Heavy Metal, not Rap. In fact I had never heard anything remotely similar up to that point - I didn't even know if I liked it at first!

The name of the band is so well chosen - fuelled by the raw, explosive lead vocals, the music transports an irresistibly positive, energizing anger, which totally fit my state of mind at that time. I didn't even need to understand the lyrics, and only years later learned what they actually sang about.

The songs are extremely riff-based, both guitar and bass lines are melodic and catchy. The drums are minimalistic but endlessly groovy, and make it impossible to not start moving. The songwriting is extremely dynamic, with well-timed breaks, atmospheric slower parts, gradual build-ups, and then wild eruptions.

Sometimes I need music that punches me right in the face. And Rage Against The Machine delivers.
