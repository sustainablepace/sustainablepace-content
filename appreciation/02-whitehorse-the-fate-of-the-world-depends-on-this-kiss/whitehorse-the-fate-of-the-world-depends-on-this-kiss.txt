Whitehorse is a husband and wife duo from Canada, stylistically rooted in Americana, but sound like a full band because they make heavy use of loop machines. I have discovered them on a (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90PxLl6Gt-c text:Tiny-Desk-like concert for CBC) around 2012. Around this time they released their second studio album "The Fate Of The World Depends On This Kiss". I'm always profoundly moved by two voices blending as well as theirs, especially when their range is as varied as here. They have both powerful, rhythmic songs, interspersed with the characteristically reverberating guitar licks, as well as delicate, elegiac ballads.

As they are a pretty unknown band in Europe, they hardly ever tour this side of the Atlantic. However, in 2013, they played a gig in Horst in the Netherlands, and my wife and I drove there to see them. It was in a (link:http://cambrinusconcerten.nl/ text:small music club) celebrating some kind of anniversary, with only about 60 guests. But Whitehorse played two sets, the last one until 1 am in the morning. During the intermission I talked to them and requested a song my wife especially liked, they said no problem, and started their second set with it. That was so kind, and I'm grateful I've been one of the few to have come.
