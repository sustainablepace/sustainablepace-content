Title: Appreciation

----

Text:

I'm thankful for a lot of things in my life - I want to share my appreciation in order to feel it clearer and more intensely. Most things are too personal to share on a public blog, so I will mostly write about films and music. I appreciate these art forms because they have a dream-like quality that helps me transcend the confinement of day-to-day numbness, and experience depth and wholeness.

There are a few simple rules

 - __Brevity__: I want to keep each entry at about 1000 characters. I want to lower the barrier and hope I can make writing more of a habit that way. By focusing on brevity I want to capture the essence of the reasons for appreciation.
 - __Personal__: Entries will be strictly personal. I'm not a film or music critic, so I will not drop names or use expert language, and I will not research. I will make a personal connection by interweaving descriptions with memories. Everything you read about here comes from first hand sensory experience.
