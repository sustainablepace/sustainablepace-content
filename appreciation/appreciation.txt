Title: Appreciation

----

Text:

I'm thankful for a lot of things in my life - I want to share what I appreciate to experience thankfulness clearer and more intensely. I will write about thoughts and feelings, films and music, maybe about things I own, about memories.

There are a few simple rules

 - __Brevity__: I want to keep each entry at about 1000 characters. I want to lower the barrier and hope I can make writing more of a habit that way.
 - __Personal__: Entries will be strictly personal. I'm not a film or music critic, I will not drop names, I will not research. Everything you read about here comes from first hand sensory experience.
