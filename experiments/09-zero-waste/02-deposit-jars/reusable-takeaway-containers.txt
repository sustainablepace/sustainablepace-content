When buying groceries it's always a challenge to pick the product with the least harmful packaging.

Obviously, there is always an alternative to wrecking your brain: either buy the product without packaging, or simply don't buy the product! To me this works surprisingly well. You can get a lot of fruit and vegetables at local markets, where you can put them directly in your own bags.

But sometimes you want to treat yourself to something special, for example I occasionally have a desire for yoghurt. So the challenge is: where do I buy yoghurt?

At a local butcher shop they occasionally have curd fresh from a local farm, however I have not tried bringing my own container yet.
