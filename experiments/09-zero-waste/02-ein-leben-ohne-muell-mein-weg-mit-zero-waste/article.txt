What we do between 2020 and 2030 will decide the future of humanity on the planet. There are various tipping points that have been crossed or are about to be reached. This will result in irreversible changes and life as we know it will come to an end. This scenario is overwhelming, and it's easy to ignore it or become paralyzed.
