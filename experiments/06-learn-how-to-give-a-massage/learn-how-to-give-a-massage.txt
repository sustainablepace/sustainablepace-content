There were three aspects about giving massages that intrigued me

- Hands over brain
- Empathy
- Giving

### Hands over brain ###

In my day-to-day work I have to think a lot and I neglect my body. I like playing the guitar, where I also use my hands. I felt that massaging could be a good way to empty one's head and use my hands.

### Empathy ###

When giving a massage you have to feel what kind of touch the receiver actually needs. I thought it must be a good exercise to focus on understanding others, rather than putting my own needs and interests first.

### Giving ###

Giving is one of NEF's Five Ways To Well-Being. I thought was doing quite well with the other four ways (which are Keep Learning, Be Active, ), and could improve on the giving part.

## Decision ##

There is a well-known healing center in Bonn called Artemisa. They offered a course "Massage Basics", which span 3 weekends over 2 months, all in all about 42 hours. Artemisa seemed to me to be very rooted in a holistic approach, rather than teaching the technique only. I thought the length was perfect.

## Massaging ##

While the art of massaging is actually very old (if not the oldest form of curing), the popular massage types we know today are a quite recent invention, dating back about 150 years. 

There are various kinds of touches

- Streichung
- Knetung / Walkung
- Friktion

They differ in the degree of pressure that is applied to the receiver's body. While Streichung is more about massaging the skin, Knetung is massaging the underlying muscles, with Friction being the most intense touch, where the pressure is supposed to soften tense muscle tissue.

### Types of massage ###

The oldest standardized form is classical massage, which was developed by some swedish person in the 19th century. Its rhythm is fast, it's more like a massage for sports. But there are countless variations, like the California style massage by Downing, which is slower and more about relaxation.

During the course we learnt various types of massages

- Back massage (classical and california style)
- Neck massage (classical)
- Head massage (california)

To me this already feels like a wide repertoire of massages.

## Learning how to massage ##

With each of the above types, we proceeded in these steps

- Anatomy (bones first, then muscles)
- Palpation (practical anatomy by identifying bones and muscles in an actual human body)
- Demonstration of a massage technique
- Actually giving the massage

I liked that I was given a theoretical introduction, which slowly built into actually doing the massage.

## Giving a massage ##

First of all, it's totally different from what I usually do. I felt that instead of memorizing and fully applying the technique it was better to let go, get into a rhythm, and focus on the well-being of the receiver of the massage.

It's very interesting to use your hands as a primary sources of sensory input. It's a great experience to find out what kinds of information you can get from a touch, things that are not observable with the eyes. 

Sight stops at skin level, but with touching you can also "see" what's going on below. Palpation is a great exercise for learning this, I wonder why this isn't the standard way to learn anatomy in schools. 

But - while all this felt good to me, it was also draining. I cannot imaging massaging for more than an hour or two per day. Not only is it physically demanding, it also is emotionally. 

Still I was surprised that I never really felt mentally tired after the massage weekends. It felt like a good counterpart to my day-to-day work.

And I liked how easily I could give others pleasure by giving a massage.

## The teacher ##

I was lucky to have a great massage teacher, JÃ¼rgen Bodhi Kendziora. He is not only extremely knowledgable and experienced, but also one of the most gentle and disarmingly funny people I have met.

It was a joy to learn from him, and I wish him well.

## Summary ##

The course gave me enough material to work with, for now I don't need a wider skill set, I just need to practice what I have learned so far. Luckily, Ms. Sustainable Pace joined me during the course, so we can learn from each other and always have an opportunity to give ourselves massages. 

However, if you live around Bonn and are in need of a massage, I would be glad to give out free massages to anyone interested - I think this is for mutual benefit.
