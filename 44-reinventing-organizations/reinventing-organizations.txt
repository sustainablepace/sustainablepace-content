There are books that are interesting, books that are inspiring, books that give you another perspective. And then there are books that just blow your mind and nothing is like it was before. Reinventing Organizations is that kind of book to me. I know I'm a little late to the party, but even five years after its initial release, this book is well worth talking about.

The premise of the book is fairly simple. Laloux states that different environments favor different forms of organizations. If the environment changes, old forms of organizations extinguish, because they fail to adapt, and new ones are emerging. He begins in the early days of human civilization with tribal organizations, up until today, where he senses a new type of organization emerging.

Let's take a look at the types of organizations he identified as common in the past, before we take a look at the new, emerging one.

## Organization types ##

### Tribal (red) ###

### Agrarian (brown) ###

### Industrial (orange) ###

### Information (green) ###

He labels these organization types with the colors of the rainbow, and the new emerging one is consequently "teal".

What I like about this approach is that every form of organization has its place, where it is the perfect fit. There is nothing about new forms being "better" or "improved" versions of former ones - the point is that Laloux does not try to convince you that the new form will be a silver bullet that will solve all your problems. It's more like a hunch, a curious glimpse of what might come in the future.

## Teal ##

### Self management ###

### Wholeness ###

### Evolutionary purpose ###
