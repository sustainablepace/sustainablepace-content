Since I have taken on a new position recently, I have had to deal with a more __fragmented work schedule__. I used to work closely with a small team of software developers, doing remote mob programming, which is awesome for focused work. I'm now working as an architect with two teams and their stakeholders, communicating at __different levels of abstraction__ and having a lot __more, albeit smaller tasks__ to deal with. I also have to find time for defining and working on strategically important, __long-term goals__.

To be honest, it's a challenge if you're trying to make a difference, and I regularly __struggle__. In search of focus I found this book on social media, of all places. Oh, the irony.

## Stolen Focus

The book starts out with the author's self-observation of his own decline in attention and focus. He simply couldn't get his writing done. It was so bad, he went on a three-month __digital detox__ away on a remote island. While he learned a lot about his habits and managed to become productive again, his routine again slowly declined afterwards. So while there are a lot of thing we as individuals can do, it's hard and never enough.

Johann Hari continues by describing the __business models of social media companies__, and compares keeping focus with a battle of the individual against thousands of the smartest engineers in the silicon valley - it can't be won. For instance, he describes technologies like __infinite scrolling__ in contrast to the __conditioning__ experiments conducted by behaviorist B.F. Skinner. In the end, the sole purpose of social media is to keep you glued to the screen as long as possible, to show you as many ads as possible. It's about __screen time, not life-time__.

But this book is not about bashing social media companies. Hari shows that the trend of declining attention can be traced back to the 19th century, and the rise of capitalism and the philosophy of economic growth. He argues, that attention is just another resource that is being recklessly exploited - without considering the consequences, like people being susceptible to manipulation and unable to deal with real crises, like global warming.

I really like how the book opens up in the second half and shows how sleep quality, diet and nutrition, or the way we raise our children factor in this equation. I especially liked his mentioning of __hypervigilance__, a trait often found in traumatized people. Hypervigilant people are having a hard to focus because their nervous system is much more sensitive to minor impulses from the outside, which are perceived as threats. They are also more susceptible to addiction.




This is not a self-help book, it's a great collection of studies and facts, that helps you see the bigger picture. There are no 10-point-plans or easy life hacks. Keeping your ability to focus and concentrate is an uphill battle. Johann Hari hopes for political movements, some kind of Attention Rebellion, to fight for regulation and de-growth in general.

The whole remote situation was great for me while being in a stable environment - despite the distractions that linger everywhere. Now that a lot of things are new to me, and I'm still trying to find the right levers, it's more challenging. Thankfully, Johann Hari has written this awesome book.
