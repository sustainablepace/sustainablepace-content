I'm (link:http://baudson.de text:Christoph Baudson), a software developer from Germany. After reading the first chapters of (link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics:_How_Mass_Collaboration_Changes_Everything text:Wikinomics) by Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, I finally decided to create a blog of my own: I liked how the book presented the idea of ideagoras, marketplaces for ideas. This is what this blog will hopefully be: An informative, helpful, open resource. 

Sharing my insights is not as altruistic as it may sound: I hope to get your input on the ideas I present, in order to create a real win-win situation. I strongly believe in the concept of mutual benefit and I hope this blog can be utilised in order to serve that purpose. Please feel free to add a comment and get the communication going!

Thanks for dropping by, feel free to stay as long as you like.
